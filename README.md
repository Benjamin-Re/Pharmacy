# Project 0

## About:
I started this webpage for CS50 Web Course
but when I was asked by a business
if I could make a website for them
I happily agreed and tried my best to 
develop a web presence for this spanish
pharmacy. They have gone with another
webpage long ago without telling me. But 
it's okay. I felt good doing something 
that would be applicable to the real world
(I know it's not that good but I'm getting 
there) instead of another hello world
page. I hope you like it.
